	<p>How will Aerifying help?</p>
		<p>Penetrates thatch or compacted soil layers
Aerifyers push through thatch or compacted layers into the soil zone. Fertilizer, air and moisture can then penetrate down to the roots.</p>


<div id="aer1">

	<p>Helps control thatch build-up
Soil brought to the surface by aerifyers contains microorganisms which help begin the breakdown of thatch tissue.</p>

<div id="aer2">

  <p>Reduces compaction
Aerifying penetrates hard soil layers and lets in air, water and fertilizer to encourage new root growth. It also provides room for the soil to expand into the holes, reducing the compaction.
